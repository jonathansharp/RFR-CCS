# RFR-CCS

This repository contains MATLAB code used in the creation of a gridded surface pCO2 product (RFR-CCS) for a region in the northeast Pacific Ocean that includes the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Datasets necessary to run this code, along with the final gridded pCO2 product can be found at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/RFR-CCS/15152013.
